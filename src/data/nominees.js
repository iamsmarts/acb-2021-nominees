    name:"Jessy Gutierrez",
    aboutYourself:`I was first introduced to ACB in 2013 by my friends and fell in love with the culture and experiences of supporting our team in the stands. From there my passion grew and I've met a lot of awesome people along the way that I would even consider family now. I really enjoy meeting new Galaxy fans and sharing our supporter culture to help bring more people together. One of my main interest is away travel and it makes me proud to see how much it has grown over the last couple of years.`,
    previousExperience:`I was part of the Viewing party committee and helped set our viewing parties in Downtown LA.`,
    whyYou:[`I consider ACB my family and I want what's best  for us. I want to see our group grow and be successful. I look forward to making an impact in the positive direction. I've worked closely with other ACB leaders and understand the hard work it takes to be on the board. I look forward to taking on this challenge if I'm elected.`,
    `Look forward to seeing all of ya in 2021 (hopefully) and sharing a beer.`],

    name:`Frank Reyes`,
    aboutYourself:`I've been a Galaxy fan since '96. I'm infinitely nostalgic about car drives with my pops from El Monte to the Rose Bowl to watch the boys play back then. Almost every trip I take involves a soccer game (usually Gz). I'm also a special needs teacher and paly as much soccer and tennis as I'm able to. I majored in communications/journalism at CSUF and I'm a pretty decent writer.`,
    previousExperience:`I have not, but I worked on my friend's DIY indie film a few years back. That may be different in many ways, but it requires an incredible amount of collective effort, brainstorming, sacrifices, responsibility and doing a ton of things people don't often notice.`,

    whyYou:[`Aside from bleeding blue, white and gold, I'd be a good choice because some of my strongest suits are that I work well within a group toward long and short term goals, as well as day-to-day logistics. `,

    `Although I've been a fan since '96, I would consider myself a newer ACB member. But even in my relatively short time in ACB I've noticed ACB has flourished in the past two to three years in regards to things like overall growth, engagement, and travel, among other things. Although a lot of that can be credited to organic growth, none of those things could be done without deliberate organizing and planning.`,

   ` Everything--from growth, to day-to-day execution, to dealing with a difficult FO, to looking to the future--requires significant vision and ganas. I'm all here for that. `

    Interests: graphic design (logos, videos, web design) `,
    previousExperience:`N/A`,
    whyYou:[`I believe I'll be a good choice because I'd stay very committed to the group. I've met some of my best friends through the section and want to ensure i can give that same opportunity to any new members coming in ,and serve the vets that've been there from the start. Even though I'm young this group and club mean so much to me and I want to make sure I serve it in any way possible whether it be from setting up, designing, and making tifo, to directly working with the FO I want to be apart of it. `],

    aboutYourself:`Holis,
    I have been a member of ACB since 2012 and been sporting the Galaxy crest since I can remember. Being a part of a SG is an indescribable feeling that you can only have when you are in the stands cheering for the G's. ACB has definitely brought me some great memories, but most importantly great FRIENDS that became FAMILY. In the year to come with ACB I hope we can grow bigger and stronger than ever before.`,
    previousExperience:`I have not served on the ACB committee but I have served in the VBLOCK committee. It has been a great pleasure to see the vision come to life.
    `,
    whyYou:[`I believe that I would be a good choice because I can bring new ideas to the table around the community service area.  As well as I feel that I have familiarity with people.
